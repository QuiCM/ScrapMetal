# Synapse & Neuron

### Purpose

The purpose of a Synapses and Neurons is to provide a dynamic event processing flow.
Synapses can be created and deleted as needed, meaning tasks such as command processing can be implemented without impacting the core ScrapMetal stack

Synapses are essentially just webservers that register themselves with ScrapMetal.
A Synapse must support SSL connections. Synapses should be aware of your ScrapMetal bot token
During registration the Synapse informs ScrapMetal of its Neurons and the events each Neuron will be processing.
